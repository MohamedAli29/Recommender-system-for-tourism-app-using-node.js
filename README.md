# Recommender-system-for-tourism-app-using-node.js
This is graduation project for ASU (CESS department), this recommender system was customized for "Yalla-Safar" app which is property rental app. it is done using node.js, mongodb, express 
Due to the lack of dataset specific for such type of program, aut-generated data set is used, python script for generated data is included.
The app reads data generated through CSV files and store them in database.
Since it was designed for wep app, a get and post requests are the methods for generating data and acquiring recommendations.
User tool for requests was "postman", but any tool to make requests is fine.
